# Note Taker App

## Description

The Note Taker App was created so that the user can quickly jot down notes or reminders and access them whenever needed. 

The saved notes appear as a list on the left side of the application. When the user clicks a saved note from the left, the full details of the note will appear on the right side of the screen. The user can clear the content of the note before saving it, or they can delete the note from the left side after it has already been saved.
